# Decentralized Community and Product Voting Platform

Welcome to our innovative decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain! This platform empowers users to create and govern vibrant online communities, fostering collaboration and collective decision-making through a transparent voting process.

## Key Features

### Community Creation and Governance
- **Establish Your Own Community**: Easily create and manage your own unique community, complete with a custom ERC20 token, name, and description.
- **Decentralized Membership**: Users can freely join existing communities by paying a membership fee in ABX tokens, our platform's native cryptocurrency.

### Product Listing and Voting
- **Propose New Products**: Community creators can list new products for voting, providing detailed information such as name, description, price, and exclusivity status.
- **Engage in Democratic Voting**: Community members can actively participate in the voting process by upvoting or downvoting proposed products using their community tokens.
- **Secure and Transparent Voting**: Our smart contracts ensure that each member's vote is recorded securely on the blockchain, promoting transparency and trust within the community.

### Product Approval and Token Staking
- **Collective Decision-Making**: After the voting period ends, the community creator can retrieve the voting results and decide whether to approve or reject the product for sale based on the collective outcome.
- **Token Staking Mechanism**: To maintain integrity, community creators must stake 50% of the proposed product's price in community tokens when listing it for voting. These tokens are either returned or partially refunded based on the voting outcome, incentivizing fair and responsible product proposals.
